# Foundry Fund Me

This project was created as part of my journey to deepen my knowledge of Solidity and blockchain development. It is a fully functional "Fund Me" application built using Foundry, a powerful framework for Ethereum smart contracts.

## Getting Started

This guide will help you get started with the project, whether you're running it locally or deploying it to a testnet or mainnet.

---

## Requirements

### 1. Git
Ensure Git is installed by running:
```bash
git --version
Expected output:

bash
Copy code
git version x.x.x
2. Foundry
Install Foundry by following the instructions here. Check installation with:

bash
Copy code
forge --version
Expected output:

bash
Copy code
forge 0.2.0 (or later)
3. Optional Tools
Gitpod: For a browser-based development environment.
Docker: For working with zkSync.
Quickstart
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Iammrgemini/foundry-fund-me.git
cd foundry-fund-me
make
Usage
Deploy Locally
To deploy the contract locally:

bash
Copy code
forge script script/DeployFundMe.s.sol
Testing
The project supports multiple tiers of testing:

Unit Tests
Forked Tests
Run tests with:

bash
Copy code
forge test
Run a specific test:

bash
Copy code
forge test --match-test testFunctionName
Test Coverage
Generate test coverage reports with:

bash
Copy code
forge coverage
Deployment to Testnet or Mainnet
1. Set Environment Variables
Create a .env file and include the following:

env
Copy code
SEPOLIA_RPC_URL=<your-sepolia-rpc-url>
PRIVATE_KEY=<your-private-key>
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=<your-etherscan-api-key>
2. Deploy
Deploy your contract with:

bash
Copy code
forge script script/DeployFundMe.s.sol --rpc-url $SEPOLIA_RPC_URL --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY --broadcast --verify --etherscan-api-key $ETHERSCAN_API_KEY
Scripts
After deploying, interact with the contract using the following scripts:

Fund the Contract
bash
Copy code
cast send <FUNDME_CONTRACT_ADDRESS> "fund()" --value 0.1ether --private-key <PRIVATE_KEY>
Withdraw Funds
bash
Copy code
cast send <FUNDME_CONTRACT_ADDRESS> "withdraw()" --private-key <PRIVATE_KEY>
Estimate Gas
Estimate gas usage:

bash
Copy code
forge snapshot
Check .gas-snapshot for details.

Formatting
Ensure consistent code formatting with:

bash
Copy code
forge fmt
Additional Information
This project was inspired by my studies but personalized for my own learning and growth.
It demonstrates core concepts of Solidity, including smart contract deployment, interaction, and testing.
Summary
This project reflects my hands-on learning with Solidity, Foundry, and blockchain development. Feel free to explore, fork, or contribute!
